Description: Arduino LilyPad w/ATmega168
 The LilyPad Arduino is a microcontroller board designed for wearables
 and e-textiles. It can be sewn to fabric and similarly mounted power
 supplies, sensors and actuators with conductive thread. The board is
 based on the ATmega168V (the low-power version of the ATmega168). The
 LilyPad Arduino was designed and developed by Leah Buechley and
 SparkFun Electronics.
